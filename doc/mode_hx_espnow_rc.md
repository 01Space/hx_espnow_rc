- ESP-01 based SBUS receiver: https://github.com/RomanLut/hx_espnow_rc/blob/main/doc/rx_esp01_sbus.md
- D1 Mini based SBUS receiver: https://github.com/RomanLut/hx_espnow_rc/blob/main/doc/rx_d1_mini_sbus.md
- ESP32 based SBUS receiver: https://github.com/RomanLut/hx_espnow_rc/blob/main/doc/rx_esp32_sbus.md

#Parameters

Key: 0

Packet rate is 50Hz. 

[todo]

# Telemetry

Telemetry stream is transparent, output to bluetooth, bidirectional, ~57kBit. Suitable for Mavlink, LTE, CRSF, MCP.

Module outputs SPORT telemetry to transmitter. In future it will be possible to translate Mavlink/CRSF to SPORT. It is not implemented currently.

Additionally, the following Smartport telemetry is generated by transmitter in hx_espnow_rc profile:

**RSSI** - 0..100. Computed link quality. Shows how many packets are acknowledged by Slave on Master. 

**TRSS** - received signal strength in Dbm. Shows how well Master hears Slave ( telemetry from slave ).

**5250** - **NOIS** - Noise floor in Dbm, sensed by Master.

**5251** - **SNR** - Signal to noise ratio in Db, sensed by Master.

**5252** - **RXSI** 0..100. Computed link quality. Shows how many packets are acknowledged by Master on Slave.

**5253** - **RXSS**[^note1] - Received signal strength in Dbm on Slave. Shows how well Slave hears Master ( control packets and upcoming telemetry from Master ).

**5254** - **RXNF**[^note1] - Noise floor in Dbm, sensed by Slave.

**5255** - **RXSN**[^note1] -  Signal to noise ratio in Db, sensed by Slave.

**R9PW** - TX power in mW

**5256** - Current profile id

**5260** - **CycT** Debug: Cycle time in ms

**5261** - **Rate** Debug: Wifi rate

**5262** - **PktR** Debug: Successfull packet rate from Master to Slave, packets/second.

**A1** - Value passed from Slave, if any.

**A2** - Value passed from Slave, if any.

[^note1]: **RXSS**, **RXNF** and **RXSN** are available only if receiver is based on ESP32. These values are 0, if receiver is based on ESP8266. 


# hx_espnow_rc in LR mode

Profile to be used with:
- ESP32 based SBUS receiver: https://github.com/RomanLut/hx_espnow_rc/blob/main/doc/esp32_sbus.md

Note that receiver should be flashed with LR mode enabled ( USE_LR_MODE true ).

To enable LR mode, add parameter:
``
    "espnow_long_range_mode" : true,
``
